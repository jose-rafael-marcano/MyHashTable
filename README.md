# MyHashTable

Added junit with AssertJ to test the hashtable methods.

Using recursion in the MaxSum, calling recursive function for row=0, column=1 and for row=1,column=1 and row 1,column=0, the use the max of the 3 recursions, the rest of the cells are traversed recursively using the 8 rule positions when is possible.
