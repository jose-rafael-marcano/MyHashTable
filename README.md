# MyHashTable

Added junit with AssertJ to test the hashtable methods. Using direct chaining with the linked list for collision resolution technique.


Using recursion in the MaxSum, calling recursive function for row=0, column=1 and for row=1,column=1 and row 1,column=0, the use the max of the 3 recursions, the rest of the cells are traversed recursively using the 8 rule positions when is possible.
